Integer linear programs for graph problems
******************************************

GraphILP is a Python API to automatically cast graph-related optimisation problems into integer linear programming (ILP) instances.
See the :ref:`introduction` to get an idea of the relationship between optimisation problems on graphs and ILPs.
It also lists a number of examples that are ideal for a quick start with GraphILP.
